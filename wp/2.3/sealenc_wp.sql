The table below shows the actual breakdown of the poll votes, of which there were 2,651. As you can see, there were four main contenders: Dean J. Robinson&#8217;s Fluency-based submissions (two variations), the existing 2.7 interface, and Matt Thomas&#8217;s comp (MT), which exists somewhere between them in terms of style. Note: GB was a late entry, and was posted after over 900 votes had already been collected.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaksvote.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaksvote.png" alt="The voting results" /></a></p>\n<p><img class="alignleft" title="Top image: Dean Robinson, Bottom image: Matt Thomas" src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaks_dr_mt.png" alt="Top two submissions by Robinson and Thomas" width="410" height="517" align="left" /></p>\n<p>As several people have rightly pointed out, the Fluency-style designs not only took the top spot, but in combination added up to a higher percentage than any other. We&#8217;re not focusing solely on that statistic, though, because had other designers submitted multiple versions, the numbers might have looked different. What was most interesting for me was checking in on the votes over the course of the two days the poll was open. The top three (Fluency-dark, Current 2.7, MT) kept beating each other out for the #1 spot as they cycled back and forth through the top three slots, and had the poll closed on time (left it open a little longer in case anyone translated the time zone incorrectly), the order would have been a bit different.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more interesting to me is the overall style that seems to be preferred among voters, as Matt&#8217;s comp has some stylistic similarities to Dean&#8217;s (see image at left). It also would be interesting to know how many of the votes for the current 2.7 interface were based on thinking it looked the best vs. how many were votes against changing the interface at all so soon after the 2.7 redesign. If you want to comment on what you liked best and/or least about any of the designs, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/265261">this thread</a> is a good place.</p>\n<p>So what happens now? However we look at it, the Fluency-style designs clearly have a lot of fans. Then again, so do the designs of Matt Thomas (he&#8217;s behind the current style of 2.7, remember, in addition to the comp labeled MT). To give the interface the attention it is due, and to take seriously some of the interface feedback around usability and accessibility, we&#8217;re going to leave the looks alone for 2.8.

The table below shows the actual breakdown of the poll votes, of which there were 2,651. As you can see, there were four main contenders: Dean J. Robinson&#8217;s Fluency-based submissions (two variations), the existing 2.7 interface, and Matt Thomas&#8217;s comp (MT), which exists somewhere between them in terms of style. Note: GB was a late entry, and was posted after over 900 votes had already been collected.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaksvote.png"><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaksvote.png" alt="The voting results" /></a></p>\n<p><img class="alignleft" title="Top image: Dean Robinson, Bottom image: Matt Thomas" src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2009/04/tweaks_dr_mt.png" alt="Top two submissions by Robinson and Thomas" width="410" height="517" align="left" /></p>\n<p>As several people have rightly pointed out, the Fluency-style designs not only took the top spot, but in combination added up to a higher percentage than any other. We&#8217;re not focusing solely on that statistic, though, because had other designers submitted multiple versions, the numbers might have looked different. What was most interesting for me was checking in on the votes over the course of the two days the poll was open. The top three (Fluency-dark, Current 2.7, MT) kept beating each other out for the #1 spot as they cycled back and forth through the top three slots, and had the poll closed on time (left it open a little longer in case anyone translated the time zone incorrectly), the order would have been a bit different.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more interesting to me is the overall style that seems to be preferred among voters, as Matt&#8217;s comp has some stylistic similarities to Dean&#8217;s (see image at left). It also would be interesting to know how many of the votes for the current 2.7 interface were based on thinking it looked the best vs. how many were votes against changing the interface at all so soon after the 2.7 redesign. If you want to comment on what you liked best and/or least about any of the designs, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/265261">this thread</a> is a good place.</p>\n<p>So what happens now? However we look at it, the Fluency-style designs clearly have a lot of fans. Then again, so do the designs of Matt Thomas (he&#8217;s behind the current style of 2.7, remember, in addition to the comp labeled MT). To give the interface the attention it is due, and to take seriously some of the interface feedback around usability and accessibility, we&#8217;re going to leave the looks alone for 2.8. It&#8217;s our guess that a revised style will make into 2.9 early in the development cycle to allow us plenty of time for user testing and revision. How close it winds up being to the comps submitted in this design tweaks challenge will depend, but in the meantime:</p>\n<p>Congratulations, <a href="http://deanjrobinson.com/">Dean J.

This is because your browser keeps a copy of the CSS cached on your hard drive. Depending on how your server is set up, it may not check for a new version of the stylesheet for a couple hours, or longer! And even if emyou/em force-reload to see the changes, visitors who have previously accessed your site may still get the old CSS.

First, determine the scope of your test and create a test protocol/script. Determine the audience segments to be included in the test group(s), and begin recruiting. Recruiting may mean hiring an agency to find participants, but for testing WordPress, it makes more sense to recruit from within this community, so that means making a screening survey, reading all the responses, segmenting the respondents into categories and contacting people until you#8217;ve filled your desired quotas (for whatever segments you#8217;re seeking, such as newbie, experienced user, developer, CMS user, photoblogger, mobile user, etc. ). Then come the test sessions./p\npDepending on what is being tested, these last anywhere from half an hour to an hour and half apiece. Sessions are generally recorded using screen capture and web cam, with a video camera for backup. The moderator(s) generally take notes during sessions and/or (depending on what software is being used for the session capture) set markers in the video to indicate task completion, comments of interest, etc.  In some cases, auxiliary test methods such as eye-tracking may be included. When the sessions are complete, the results are analyzed. All the notes and videos are reviewed, patterns are identified, and ultimately a report is written and the feedback informs the next round of revisions./p\npSome people think it shouldn#8217;t take much time to do all this. I#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who cite a href=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.htmlan old article by Jakob Nielsen/a that says you don#8217;t need to test with more than 5 users because usability issues become clear right away. While I#8217;ve found that to be generally true, when your user base is as diverse in experience level, usage, platform  configuration, language (right to left languages have a pretty different experience) and demography as the WordPress community is, 5 users really isn#8217;t enough to get a clear picture. We try to test with at least a dozen people each round, but then we are limited to a geographic region (test in NY, test in SF, or test wherever we can schedule enough people back to back to make it worthwhile), while WordPress users are located all over the globe./p\npTo address this, we#8217;re introducing a set of new contribution opportunities to expand our usability testing program. As with development and graphic design, we#8217;re going to create an infrastructure to allow community participation in usability testing on a regular basis and in a much broader capacity than existed before, when it was limited to announcements that we needed participants in emx/em city on emy/em date.

“Smart”";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=5703";s:4:"link";s:94:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/04/29/9-ways-to-make-your-wordpress-blog-smart/";s:11:"description";s:8949:"pMany of you might be confused by the title and the term #8220;smart#8221;.  To me a #8220;smart#8221; blog is a blog that behaves differently depending on its visitors#8217; behavior and characteristics./p\npA simple example of this is a blog that displays a list of today#8217;s most popular posts on the sidebar.  The list changes based on visitors#8217; behavior so to this is definitely a smart blog feature.  There are plenty of WordPress plugins out there that do this for you automatically (e.g. a href=http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/top-10/Top 10/a), but that is not the point.  The point here is that having the ability to morph your blog per visitor activity can assist you in meeting your conversion goals (whatever they may be).  A list of popular posts is quite a simple feature, so let me take you to another level by showing you more ways to make your blog smart./p\nh3List of #8220;Smart#8221; Features to Implement on Your Blog/h3\npstrong1. Display a different welcome message to different people/strong/p\npA great way to meet conversion goals is to display different things to different types of visitors.  For example, you can show a welcome message only to new visitors and not to returning visitors.  The message could be used to encourage new visitors to subscribe to your blog#8217;s RSS feed, to download your eBook, to follow the your Twitter, or to satisfy any other conversion goal.  You can also specify a call-to-action in the message depending on where the visitor is coming from.  For example, you can ask your visitor to Digg your post if the visitor is referred to you from digg.com./p\npThere are already some plugins that automatically do this for you (e.g. a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-greet-box-wordpress-plugin/WP Greet Box/a and a href=http://www.phoenixheart.net/2008/11/referrer-detector/Referrer Detector/a) in case you were wondering how you can implement such a feature on your WordPress blog.  Again the point here is that these plugins give you the ability to morph your blog based on your audience./p\npstrong2. Show where other people went from current post/strong/p\npThis feature is similar to a list of related posts, but is a bit different because the list is determined by visitor behavior.  Most related posts plugins use an algorithm to determine post relativity, but algorithms only go so far.  Why not trust your human visitors to generate this list of related posts for you?/p\npTo implement this feature, you can install the a href=http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/where-did-they-go-from-here/Where did they go from here?/a plugin.  This plugin will add a #8220;Readers who viewed this page, also viewed#8221; section after your blog posts and track visitor activity to fill up these lists./p\npstrong3. Show related post based on search queries/strong/p\npWhen a visitor comes to your site through a search engine, they are looking for something very specific.  If they land on your site and do not immediately find what they are looking for, they are as good as gone.  It would be smart for a blog to detect these search terms from search engine visitors and display a list of posts that closely matches these terms.  That way if the current post is not what the visitor is looking for, they will be tempted to visit other posts relating to their search terms before they leave your site./p\npTo implement this, all you have to do is install either a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-greet-box-wordpress-plugin/WP Greet Box/a, a href=http://www.phoenixheart.net/2008/11/referrer-detector/Referrer Detector/a, or a href=http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/landing-sites/Landing Sites/a WordPress plugin./p\npstrong4. Thank a first time commenter/strong/p\npMost people love human interaction.  I love reading blogs because I know that there is somebody on the other side that I can email and chat with.  A good way to gain loyal readers is to thank first time commenters for contributing to your blog.  This helps you breaks the ice and assure your new reader that you are there if they ever want to email you./p\npFor this feature, you can use the a href=http://www.justinshattuck.com/2007/03/19/comment-relish-wordpress-plugin/Comment Relish/a WordPress plugin./p\npstrong5. Display custom message to people who use Ad Block software/strong/p\npI know I#8217;m going to get flamed for introducing this feature, but here goes anyway (please don#8217;t flame me too much)./p\npIf you are a blogger that makes the majority of your money from advertisements, your income is definitely hurt from ad block software installed with your visitor#8217;s browser.  A smart blog would remind visitors with ad block software that they are using ad block and suggest that they turn it off to support the blog.  Of course this message shouldn#8217;t be displayed more than once or the blog will definitely lose traffic./p\npIf you are interested in this feature, you can check out the a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/anti-adblock-wordpress-plugin/Anti-AdBlock/a WordPress plugin, which will display any message you like at any frequency (I recommend once) to visitors with ad block enabled./p\npstrong6. Selective advertising/strong/p\npAs you may know, Google Ads does #8220;smart pricing#8221; to determine how much they pay you per click.  This means that if your ad has high click-through ratio, then they will pay more per click.  You can optimize this click-through ratio by not displaying ads in situations where you know that they are not going to be clicked.  To do this, you have to realize that there are two types of visitors to your blog: new and returning.  New visitors are more likely to click on an advertisement than returning visitors so it is best if you do not show these ads to returning visitors at all./p\npYou can implement this feature by installing a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/Who Sees Ads?/a, which is the ultimate plugin for selectively displaying advertisments./p\npstrong7. Mini #8220;About#8221; section only for new visitors/strong/p\npHave you even been to a blog that as a mini #8220;About#8221; section in the sidebar? (If not, you can check out a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/Planet Ozh/a#8217;s sidebar)  Doesn#8217;t it make sense to show this section only to new visitors?  Hiding the section for returning visitors helps you reduce clutter in your sidebar and helps you bring other important content above the fold./p\npYou can also implement this using a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/Who Sees Ads?/a.  Just treat the #8220;About#8221; section as an ad unit in your sidebar and specify that it should only be displayed to new visitors./p\npstrong8. Ask for donations from returning visitors/strong/p\npTo me, it doesn#8217;t really make sense to ask a new visitor for donations because I#8217;m not sure how they feel about my content yet.  Now if the visitor returns quite often, then I know that my content is useful to them.  I am more comfortable asking regular readers for donations as they are more inclined to donate anyway.  To me, this feature implemented along with feature #6 makes a whole lot of sense.  New visitors only see ads and returning visitors only see donation requests./p\npYou can also implement this feature with a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/Who Sees Ads?/a.  Just treat the donate banner as an ad unit and specify that it should only be displayed to regular visitors./p\npstrong9. Display #8220;Out on Vacation#8221; message/strong/p\npEverybody needs to take a break once in a while.  Wouldn#8217;t it be nice to let your readers know that you are on vacation and let them know when to expect you back?  That way you don#8217;t lose readers from inactivity or lose readers who comment expecting an immediate reply./p\npThis is not really a feature based on visitor behavior, but I feel that it is still a smart feature because the message is only displayed to visitors that visit within a certain time period./p\npYou can again use a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/Who Sees Ads?/a to display an #8220;Out on Vacation#8221; message near the top of your blog between a specific date range.  I love this because when you come back from vacation, you won#8217;t have to remember to take down the notification banner.  You can also reuse the same notification banner the next time you go on vacation./p\nh3Conclusion/h3\npBy now, I think you guys get what I mean by a #8220;smart#8221; blog.  Hopefully, these powerful plugins can help you reshape your blog into a more visitor oriented blog./p\npGot a #8220;smart#8221; blog feature of your own?  Please share any other #8220;smart#8221; blog ideas in the comments section./p";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 10:00:56 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:14:"Thaya Kareeson";}s:7:"summary";s:8949:"pMany of you might be confused by the title and the term #8220;smart#8221;.  To me a #8220;smart#8221; blog is a blog that behaves differently depending on its visitors#8217; behavior and characteristics./p\npA simple example of this is a blog that displays a list of today#8217;s most popular posts on the sidebar.  The list changes based on visitors#8217; behavior so to this is definitely a smart blog feature.  There are plenty of WordPress plugins out there that do this for you automatically (e.g. a href=http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/top-10/Top 10/a), but that is not the point.  The point here is that having the ability to morph your blog per visitor activity can assist you in meeting your conversion goals (whatever they may be).  A list of popular posts is quite a simple feature, so let me take you to another level by showing you more ways to make your blog smart./p\nh3List of #8220;Smart#8221; Features to Implement on Your Blog/h3\npstrong1. Display a different welcome message to different people/strong/p\npA great way to meet conversion goals is to display different things to different types of visitors.  For example, you can show a welcome message only to new visitors and not to returning visitors.  The message could be used to encourage new visitors to subscribe to your blog#8217;s RSS feed, to download your eBook, to follow the your Twitter, or to satisfy any other conversion goal.  You can also specify a call-to-action in the message depending on where the visitor is coming from.  For example, you can ask your visitor to Digg your post if the visitor is referred to you from digg.com./p\npThere are already some plugins that automatically do this for you (e.g. a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-greet-box-wordpress-plugin/WP Greet Box/a and a href=http://www.phoenixheart.net/2008/11/referrer-detector/Referrer Detector/a) in case you were wondering how you can implement such a feature on your WordPress blog.  Again the point here is that these plugins give you the ability to morph your blog based on your audience./p\npstrong2. Show where other people went from current post/strong/p\npThis feature is similar to a list of related posts, but is a bit different because the list is determined by visitor behavior.  Most related posts plugins use an algorithm to determine post relativity, but algorithms only go so far.  Why not trust your human visitors to generate this list of related posts for you?/p\npTo implement this feature, you can install the a href=http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/where-did-they-go-from-here/Where did they go from here?/a plugin.  This plugin will add a #8220;Readers who viewed this page, also viewed#8221; section after your blog posts and track visitor activity to fill up these lists./p\npstrong3. Show related post based on search queries/strong/p\npWhen a visitor comes to your site through a search engine, they are looking for something very specific.  If they land on your site and do not immediately find what they are looking for, they are as good as gone.  It would be smart for a blog to detect these search terms from search engine visitors and display a list of posts that closely matches these terms.  That way if the current post is not what the visitor is looking for, they will be tempted to visit other posts relating to their search terms before they leave your site./p\npTo implement this, all you have to do is install either a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-greet-box-wordpress-plugin/WP Greet Box/a, a href=http://www.phoenixheart.net/2008/11/referrer-detector/Referrer Detector/a, or a href=http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/landing-sites/Landing Sites/a WordPress plugin./p\npstrong4. Thank a first time commenter/strong/p\npMost people love human interaction.  I love reading blogs because I know that there is somebody on the other side that I can email and chat with.  A good way to gain loyal readers is to thank first time commenters for contributing to your blog.  This helps you breaks the ice and assure your new reader that you are there if they ever want to email you./p\npFor this feature, you can use the a href=http://www.justinshattuck.com/2007/03/19/comment-relish-wordpress-plugin/Comment Relish/a WordPress plugin./p\npstrong5. Display custom message to people who use Ad Block software/strong/p\npI know I#8217;m going to get flamed for introducing this feature, but here goes anyway (please don#8217;t flame me too much)./p\npIf you are a blogger that makes the majority of your money from advertisements, your income is definitely hurt from ad block software installed with your visitor#8217;s browser.  A smart blog would remind visitors with ad block software that they are using ad block and suggest that they turn it off to support the blog.  Of course this message shouldn#8217;t be displayed more than once or the blog will definitely lose traffic./p\npIf you are interested in this feature, you can check out the a href=http://omninoggin.com/wordpress-plugins/anti-adblock-wordpress-plugin/Anti-AdBlock/a WordPress plugin, which will display any message you like at any frequency (I recommend once) to visitors with ad block enabled./p\npstrong6. Selective advertising/strong/p\npAs you may know, Google Ads does #8220;smart pricing#8221; to determine how much they pay you per click.  This means that if your ad has high click-through ratio, then they will pay more per click.  You can optimize this click-through ratio by not displaying ads in situations where you know that they are not going to be clicked.  To do this, you have to realize that there are two types of visitors to your blog: new and returning.  New visitors are more likely to click on an advertisement than returning visitors so it is best if you do not show these ads to returning visitors at all./p\npYou can implement this feature by installing a href=http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/Who Sees Ads?/a, which is the ultimate plugin for selectively displaying advertisments./p\npstrong7.

But it#8217;s easy to forget to look at the link before approving a comment, or give the comment author the benefit of the doubt without checking closely.  And spammers have recently learned to post several comments over time, the first of which contains no link or obvious clue.

You are undermining your site#8217;s SEO./strong/p\npThe spammer#8217;s web site might seem inoffensive on face value.  But the black-hat SEO and spam methods used by its promoter are not. That same spammer is busy building backlinks from anywhere they can find them, including some of the web#8217;s worst neighbourhoods.  By regularly publishing links to spammers#8217; web sites, you#8217;re giving Google and other search engines a hint that links from your blog are poor quality./p\npNow it#8217;s true that Google will emtry/em not to penalize a web site for inadvertently linking to a a href=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=enamp;answer=35769#3bad neighbourhood/a.  But even if they don#8217;t, you are weakening the value of each of the other links from your blog - #8220;diluting your GoogleJuice#8221;, if you like - and helping to validate the spammer#8217;s web site.  In some cases you might even find that emyou are helping the spammer overtake your blog in search engine results/em./p\npstrong2. You are attracting more spammers./strong/p\npLess skilled spammers will deliberately emseek out blogs that other spammers have successfully spammed/em, because they know they are easy targets.  Organized spammers circulate lists of such blogs (for a small fee of course).  And professionals keep their own lists of previous victims, because they know future spam is even more likely to be approved there.  By letting some spam through - even seemingly harmless ones - you are providing a signal to spammers that your blog is a profitable target.  (Experienced bloggers will be familiar with this phenomenon: you accidentally approve one seemingly unremarkable spam comment, and a big batch of ugly spam follows soon after)./p\npWordPress and many other blog applications have a feature, independent of Akismet, where regular users who have had at least one comment approved, will automatically skip the moderation queue next time and have their comments published right away.  Spammers know this, and they#8217;ll come back to take advantage of it.  Often they#8217;ll link to a harmless looking site in their first comment (or include no link at all), but link to progressively more blatant spam in subsequent comments./p\npstrong3. You are damaging your reputation./strong/p\npYou might not click on the links in all the comments on your blog, but some of your readers will.  And some of those links will go to sites that are sleazy, offensive, or harmful./p\npWorse still, a spam tactic that is becoming more popular is to first post a small number of spam comments on innocent blogs; then send a large volume of spam to other web sites linking to the blog post that contains those comments.  (They do this to try to get around spam filters and blacklist that recognize and catch links to their own site)./p\npIf you do publish spam comments on your blog, you might discover later that thousands of other blogs and forums have been spammed with emlinks to your blog/em./p\npSo what should you do about it?/p\npAkismet will almost always catch these comments and put them in your Spam folder.  Usually you don#8217;t need to do anything; just don#8217;t approve them for publication./p\npWe have a real-time view of spam activity on millions of blogs around the world, so we can detect empatterns in behaviour/em that can#8217;t be seen by looking at any one single comment.  If a bland, generic comment turns up in your spam folder, you should be suspicious of it - Akismet flagged it for a reason.  Think twice before approving it for publication.  Unless you know the author, it almost certainly emis/em spam #8212; or a subtle precursor to it./p\npAlso, keep an eye out for forthcoming Akismet updates.  In addition to our usual work behind the scenes monitoring and adapting to new spam techniques, we#8217;re developing some new features designed specifically to help protect against the potential harm done by spammers./p\n  a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a img alt= border=0 src=http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.comblog=116920post=157subd=akismetref=feed=1 //div";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 08:04:09 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Alex";}s:7:"summary";s:6543:"div class=snap_previewbr /pOne of the most common forms of comment and pingback spam right now is the relatively subtle, ambiguous kind #8212; short phrases or questions that are not obviously spam, at least on face value.

You are undermining your site#8217;s SEO./strong/p\npThe spammer#8217;s web site might seem inoffensive on face value.  But the black-hat SEO and spam methods used by its promoter are not. That same spammer is busy building backlinks from anywhere they can find them, including some of the web#8217;s worst neighbourhoods.  By regularly publishing links to spammers#8217; web sites, you#8217;re giving Google and other search engines a hint that links from your blog are poor quality./p\npNow it#8217;s true that Google will emtry/em not to penalize a web site for inadvertently linking to a a href=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=enamp;answer=35769#3bad neighbourhood/a.  But even if they don#8217;t, you are weakening the value of each of the other links from your blog - #8220;diluting your GoogleJuice#8221;, if you like - and helping to validate the spammer#8217;s web site.  In some cases you might even find that emyou are helping the spammer overtake your blog in search engine results/em./p\npstrong2. You are attracting more spammers./strong/p\npLess skilled spammers will deliberately emseek out blogs that other spammers have successfully spammed/em, because they know they are easy targets.  Organized spammers circulate lists of such blogs (for a small fee of course).  And professionals keep their own lists of previous victims, because they know future spam is even more likely to be approved there.  By letting some spam through - even seemingly harmless ones - you are providing a signal to spammers that your blog is a profitable target.  (Experienced bloggers will be familiar with this phenomenon: you accidentally approve one seemingly unremarkable spam comment, and a big batch of ugly spam follows soon after)./p\npWordPress and many other blog applications have a feature, independent of Akismet, where regular users who have had at least one comment approved, will automatically skip the moderation queue next time and have their comments published right away.  Spammers know this, and they#8217;ll come back to take advantage of it.  Often they#8217;ll link to a harmless looking site in their first comment (or include no link at all), but link to progressively more blatant spam in subsequent comments./p\npstrong3. You are damaging your reputation./strong/p\npYou might not click on the links in all the comments on your blog, but some of your readers will.  And some of those links will go to sites that are sleazy, offensive, or harmful./p\npWorse still, a spam tactic that is becoming more popular is to first post a small number of spam comments on innocent blogs; then send a large volume of spam to other web sites linking to the blog post that contains those comments.  (They do this to try to get around spam filters and blacklist that recognize and catch links to their own site)./p\npIf you do publish spam comments on your blog, you might discover later that thousands of other blogs and forums have been spammed with emlinks to your blog/em./p\npSo what should you do about it?/p\npAkismet will almost always catch these comments and put them in your Spam folder.  Usually you don#8217;t need to do anything; just don#8217;t approve them for publication./p\npWe have a real-time view of spam activity on millions of blogs around the world, so we can detect empatterns in behaviour/em that can#8217;t be seen by looking at any one single comment.  If a bland, generic comment turns up in your spam folder, you should be suspicious of it - Akismet flagged it for a reason.  Think twice before approving it for publication.  Unless you know the author, it almost certainly emis/em spam #8212; or a subtle precursor to it./p\npAlso, keep an eye out for forthcoming Akismet updates.  In addition to our usual work behind the scenes monitoring and adapting to new spam techniques, we#8217;re developing some new features designed specifically to help protect against the potential harm done by spammers./p\n  a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a a rel=nofollow href=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/akismet.wordpress.com/157/img alt= border=0 src=http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/akismet.wordpress.com/157/ //a img alt= border=0 src=http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.comblog=116920post=157subd=akismetref=feed=1 //div";}i:41;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:37:"WordPress.tv: WordPress.tv is hiring!";s:4:"guid";s:30:"http://blog.wordpress.tv/?p=58";s:4:"link";s:58:"http://blog.wordpress.tv/2009/04/28/wordpresstv-is-hiring/";s:11:"description";s:3987:"div class=snap_previewbr /pstrongI#8217;m super-excited to say that we#8217;re hiring here at WordPress.tv towers!/strong/p\npWith our combined focus on community content and putting out fresh tutorials for you, there are only so many hours a day in the average week.

My wife, a href=http://digitaldivas.net/Susan/a, uses Drupal at her job, and I figured it might be nice to offer her some real ideas every once in a while, instead of just saying, #8220;if you were using a href=http://wordpress.org/WordPress/a, I could help you figure out how to do that.#8221; And no, they emcan#8217;t/em just switch to WordPress, unfortunately img src=http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:) class=wp-smiley / Drupal does have a steep learning curve (if you really want to do more interesting things with it), but it also has some nifty architectural bits. While much of it still feels alien to me, some of it has more in common with WordPress than I expected. When I feel like I#8217;ve learned enough, I#8217;ll try to write up a WordPress/Drupal comparison (mostly from the developer#8217;s perspective)./p";}i:49;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:67:"Weblog Tools Collection: Blogging and WordPress links for 4/25/2009";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=5674";s:4:"link";s:94:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/04/25/blogging-and-wordpress-links-for-4252009/";s:11:"description";s:1834:"pa href=http://www.studiopress.com/tips/how-to-use-the-wordpress-image-uploader-to-create-thumbnails.htmHow to use the WordPress image uploader to create thumbnails/a.: Brian explains how to automatically generate thumbnails (and resize images into various sizes) for your pictures using the WordPress image uploader./p\npa href=http://wpengineer.com/embed-wordpress-functions-outside-wordpress/How to embed WordPress functions outside of WordPress/a.: WP Engineer explains how to embed WordPress functions into code that is outside of WordPress.

Running regular expressions consumes time and memory, and it’s ideal to avoid it if alternate approaches are available. However, even when there are one or more alternate approaches, it is seldom the case that one option is clearly the best one to use all the time. There are always a number of factors that you need to consider.\r\n\r\nProbably the most common misuse of mod_rewrite is for simple redirection.

Generate a public/private key pair on the local machine\r\n(ssh client):\r\nssh-keygen -t rsa\r\n(saving the file in ~/.ssh/id_rsa as prompted)\r\n\r\n2. Just hit the &lt;CR&gt; when asked for passphrase (twice) for no\r\npassphrase.  If you do use a passphrase, you will also need to use\r\nssh-agent so you only have to type the passphrase once per session.\r\nIf you don’t use a passphrase, simply logging onto your local\r\ncomputer or getting access to the keyfile in any way will suffice\r\nto access any ssh servers which have that key authorized for login.\r\n\r\n3. This creates two files:\r\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\n4. On the target machine (ssh server):\r\ncd\r\nmkdir -p .ssh\r\nchmod 0700 .ssh\r\n\r\n5. On your local machine (ssh client): (one line)\r\nssh {serverhostname}\r\ncat ‘&gt;&gt;’ ‘~/.ssh/authorized_keys2′ &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nor, for OpenSSH, (one line)\r\nssh {serverhostname}\r\ncat ‘&gt;&gt;’ ‘~/.ssh/authorized_keys’ &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nYou can test it out with\r\nssh {serverhostname}\r\nand you should be log onto the server machine without further need to type\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n<strong>Method 2:</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you decided to use a passphrase, do:\r\nssh-agent $SHELL\r\nssh-add\r\nssh {serverhostname}\r\nYou will be prompted for your key passphrase when you use ssh-add, but not\r\nsubsequently when you use ssh.  For use with vim, you can use &gt;\r\nssh-agent vim\r\nand, when next within vim, use\r\n:!ssh-add\r\nAlternatively, you can apply ssh-agent to the terminal you’re planning on\r\nrunning vim in:\r\nssh-agent xterm &amp;\r\nand do ssh-add whenever you need.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, folks on the vim mailing list have mentioned that Pageant helps\r\nwith avoiding the constant need to enter the password.\r\n\r\n<strong>Method 3:</strong>\r\n\r\nKingston Fung wrote about another way to avoid constantly needing to enter\r\npasswords:\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the need to type in the password for scp each time, you\r\nprovide a hack in the docs to set up a non password ssh account. I found a\r\nbetter way to do that: I can use a regular ssh account which uses a\r\npassword to access the material without the need to key-in the password\r\neach time. It’s good for security and convenience. I tried ssh public key\r\nauthorization + ssh-agent, implementing this, and it works!
