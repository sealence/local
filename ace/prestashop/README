INSTALLATION

Simply go to your PrestaShop web directory and use installer :-)

If you have any PHP error, perhaps you don't have PHP5 or you need to activate it on your web host.
Please go to our forum to find pre-installation settings (PHP 5, htaccess) for certain hosting services (1&1, Free, Lycos, OVH, Infomaniak, Amen, GoDaddy, etc).
